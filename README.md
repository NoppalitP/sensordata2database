# Getting sensor data and insert to database

## Intro

ESP32 microcontroller gathers data from a sensor and a web service, processes it, and stores it in a database. 

## The process

### 1. Sensor Data Acquisition:

- The ESP32 then communicates with the BME680 sensor through the I2C protocol.
- The BME680 sensor measures environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and pressure.
- This sensor data is sent back to the ESP32

### 2. ESP 32 Making a request

- The ESP32 microcontroller starts by making an HTTP GET request to the Google Sheet.
- This request retrieves data from the sheet, potentially containing instructions or configuration settings for the project.

### 3. Google App Script working process

- handle an HTTP GET request with parameters related to sensor
- integration with a Google Sheet
- Appending Data to the Google Sheet

### 4. Python Program that does

- Connects to a Google Sheets document
- Retrieves all records from the selected worksheet
- Inserts the transformed data into the "bme680_data" table in the MySQL database
